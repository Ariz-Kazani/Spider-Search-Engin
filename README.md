# Web Crawler & Search Engine

## Introduction

This project implements a web crawler and search engine in Java (with a version also in python that does not have a GUI). The crawler navigates the web starting from a seed URL, collecting data from various web pages, and storing the information necessary for search and ranking purposes. The search engine component processes user queries, providing relevant search results based on the collected data using various PageRank algorithms.

## Installation

This step slightly varies between the two versions.

- Python

  1.  Simply get the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

  2.  Run a crawl to get searchable data.

  3.  Create a method in a python file that accepts user queries and displays the results (the search engine will return top 10 results).

- Java

  1.  Download [Java](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/) and [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/).

  2.  Configure JavaFX, to be in the path of the project.

  3.  Run a crawl to get searchable data.

  4.  CrawlerApp.java will accept user queries.

## Usage & Features

1.  Simple and interactive GUI (for java version).

2.  Fast and accurate queries guaranteed with various mathematical models and algorithms used.

3.  Efficient data storage.
